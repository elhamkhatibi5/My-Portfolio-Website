My- Portfolio-Website 

## Theme / Inspiration
This portfolio website is inspired by a clean, professional, and minimalist design to showcase my background as an Economics graduate and former Budget Manager, combined with my growing passion for computer science and web development.

## Design Decisions
- Used two Google Fonts: Poppins headings (modern and bold) and Open Sans-Serif for body text (readable and clean).
- Color scheme is calm and professional with navy blue (#004d99) as primary color for navigation and accents.Dark Slate gray and blue and green color.
- Responsive grid layout for projects using CSS Grid.
- Hover effects on navigation links and project cards to improve interactivity.
- Simple, semantic HTML structure for accessibility and SEO.
- Contact form with clear input fields and validation.
- Mobile-friendly design with responsive navigation.

## Challenges Faced
- Achieving responsive layouts without JavaScript.
- Styling the contact form and making it accessible.
- Balancing professional tone with creative expression using only HTML and CSS.
